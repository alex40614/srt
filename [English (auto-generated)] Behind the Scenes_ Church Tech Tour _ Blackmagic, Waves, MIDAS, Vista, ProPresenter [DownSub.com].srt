1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,600
well welcome to our control room

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,240
um we're about two flights up in our

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,759
auditorium

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,280
uh directly above the doors when you

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,400
enter so can i give you a rundown

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,679
um we actually had a really cool

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,679
opportunity to really start from scratch

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,320
in the space

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,880
because there wasn't a whole lot of tlc

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,560
from the beginning here

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,960
about two years ago we had um no glass

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,760
in here

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,960
uh actually about a year ago actually we

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,039
had no glass there was no carpet it was

15
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,160
a

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,800
that cheap kind of um vinyl flooring

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,719
which is fine for like a home but when

18
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,079
you have a high traffic area

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,399
it didn't last at all and we had a

20
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,719
particle board desk that

21
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,680
was flexing um and so and then cables

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,399
just

23
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,480
kind of everywhere so really cool

24
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,760
opportunity to do it right

25
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,920
and i'll show you some of the things we

26
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,079
were intentional about but

27
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,840
we're breaking down the station so over

28
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,680
here we have lighting land

29
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,039
uh we are running jans vista and with

30
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,559
everything we try to be good stewards

31
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,879
so um this computer is actually probably

32
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,559
about seven years old i think

33
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,400
and it used to be our graphics computer

34
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,840
and then it got demoted to lighting

35
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,000
so if it works we use it um so

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,360
we're using vista for our lighting

37
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,600
software with the 1m the

38
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,400
usb jams now it's a chroma qvista uh if

39
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,360
you're doing lighting

40
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,280
from today i would not do this this is

41
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,720
about a thousand dollars for this plus

42
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,280
500

43
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,200
for the software plus the computer i

44
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,400
would use light key it's

45
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,040
an amazing mac tool it's like 90 bucks

46
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,640
works great but this was already

47
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,400
in the works um before i came on board

48
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,840
so i'm not that

49
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,600
time to just really was the best option

50
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,040
in terms of budget so

51
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,400
but if you're once you're doing anything

52
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,799
crazy um light could be the way to go

53
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,960
moving on we have graphics we recently

54
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,280
upgraded appropriate r7 to make things

55
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,960
so much simpler um we used to use pro 6

56
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,520
and we actually had to have not one not

57
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,079
two

58
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,479
but three computers to run our graphics

59
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,000
and the reason for that was

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
we had these three screens using a

61
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
triple head to go that was one machine

62
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,640
we had pastors tv and back wall that was

63
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,399
another machine and then we had a lower

64
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,240
thirds for broadcast that was another

65
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,119
machine

66
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,880
and pro 6's are limited so we upgraded

67
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,160
the pro seven

68
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,080
um and then we got this guy here which

69
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,200
has five

70
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,360
uh outputs and then we have this alpha

71
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,040
keyer which does our lower thirds and

72
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,840
all it does

73
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,520
it gets random right from purple center

74
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,360
right there so

75
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,720
this guy down here probably looks really

76
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,120
cool these are just this is a control

77
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,000
surface

78
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,160
to talk to our video matrix if you don't

79
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,319
know what a video matrix is

80
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,160
think of like the av receiver you might

81
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,440
have at your home

82
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,319
where you have a bunch of hdmi ins and

83
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,840
you know maybe an output to your tv

84
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,720
except

85
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,120
rather than it being hdmi it's sdi and

86
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,400
rather being one output

87
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,720
it's 40 inputs and 40 outputs so every

88
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,760
projector

89
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,000
every computer out input every camera

90
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
input everything

91
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,879
goes in the matrix and lets us route

92
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,200
things so if you notice on sunday when

93
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,920
steve's tv

94
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,400
is black it's actually not off it just

95
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,000
we're just sending a black signal

96
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,200
as one of our inputs we have a black

97
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,440
signal and if i want to route

98
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,280
uh the probe center signal to it just

99
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,959
click this button and then

100
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,879
take it and then now his tv would appear

101
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,720
to turn on it was on the whole time it

102
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,040
just

103
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,959
had a black signal up so i can now do

104
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,400
that

105
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,319
and that's we can program this to do

106
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,720
anything uh moving on we have a phone

107
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,640
uh this is useful for talking to

108
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,400
downstairs we can also call our student

109
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,920
room if we have a multi-room event going

110
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,720
on

111
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,440
and this also acts as a com system of

112
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,480
sort so

113
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,519
if i click audio

114
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,720
you might not be able to hear there's a

115
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,159
phone ringing in our audio room over

116
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,720
there

117
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,080
and that's how we can talk to each other

118
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,360
so as a video director or as the

119
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,959
graphics director i can pick up and call

120
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,000
them

121
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,599
and they can call me and then also we

122
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,720
have one at front of house so we can

123
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,760
ring in front of house

124
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,280
it does not actually ring the phone it

125
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,720
just flashes the light though since

126
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,239
they're in service

127
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,000
this is a much cheaper system since we

128
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,599
already had a phone system versus

129
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,599
installing something like clearcom

130
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,760
um so that that's a good solution

131
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,200
security radio for

132
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,879
talking to our our sheriff's office

133
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,239
officer we have on site

134
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,319
and then here is video world so this is

135
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,480
where we mix video from

136
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,879
um this is just a control surface though

137
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,400
actually there's only one cable plugged

138
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
into this thing and it's this guy it's a

139
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,720
poe cable

140
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,799
it's all powered over the network um

141
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,640
i'll plug that back in

142
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,040
and so um

143
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,720
this guy is how we uh switch cameras so

144
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,478
um before while this turning back on i

145
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,519
probably shouldn't have unplugged that

146
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,880
i'll explain what's happening up here so

147
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,400
this monitor right here

148
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,160
is our multi-view monitor we have

149
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,680
preview program

150
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,040
meters there it's just as the director i

151
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,560
like to see make sure we have audio

152
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,360
flowing

153
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,880
cameras one two three four five as well

154
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,280
as stage display so actually i

155
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,980
open up pro presenter here

156
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,840
[Music]

157
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,639
let it spin

158
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,960
i tried to run this on a mac mini even

159
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,160
the new ones and it would not work we

160
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,360
had to use an imac

161
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,639
um but i'll go ahead and just fire up

162
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,160
uh one of the slides here

163
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,639
sweet okay cool so now you can see i

164
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,400
have graphics coming in that's just

165
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,240
the left screen so we can that that

166
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,000
little is a copy of that and that's how

167
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,280
we can take a graphic and put it on

168
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,400
broadcast

169
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,560
and then right here i have words and i

170
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,919
also have the clock there

171
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,680
if a video rolls i get a blue clock and

172
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,360
that's super helpful because

173
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,960
as a video director i can see how much

174
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,400
time is left obviously we're never

175
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,759
perfect with the clock

176
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,479
but we try to be um and i have no idea

177
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,560
what music is playing right now

178
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,919
but if i roll a video so i'll just roll

179
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,960
this is announcements you see i can

180
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,639
you see i have actually a timer there

181
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,360
which is really nice

182
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,639
let me get that off all right so uh

183
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,400
that way i can i can select the camera

184
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,240
so i'll choose camera one

185
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,240
and if i want to take that camera i can

186
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
either use the t-bar to take the camera

187
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,440
which is this guy here

188
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,479
i can use the cut button um and then i

189
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,240
can also uh

190
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,800
use the transition button i can do

191
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,080
titles so

192
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,759
um we actually have media players built

193
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,280
in to the switcher so i can media

194
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,000
players

195
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,400
i can go to media player four i think

196
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
yeah so force and then i can do

197
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,479
i'll switch it back to that if i hit

198
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,240
this button here i have a keyer built in

199
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,479
i can just boop

200
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,319
title away and i actually have more than

201
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,160
once if i leave this on

202
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,800
i can spin this knob here and you'll see

203
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,240
as i spin the knob

204
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,160
it changes so yeah there's graphics so

205
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,240
we use that a lot the second one here or

206
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,600
the first one rather is actually for our

207
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,560
lyrics

208
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,039
so if i go to pro presenter and i hit a

209
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,639
lyric

210
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,639
this guy sends that to the switcher and

211
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,680
you can see i have that which would

212
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,120
normally be on the left and right screen

213
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
and then i have my lyrics there

214
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,479
and if whatever reason if i need to turn

215
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,160
that off i can just hit this button

216
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,440
but really we never have to worry about

217
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,600
that so we leave that on

218
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,840
i only have one camera on camera one on

219
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,039
but we'll move over

220
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,919
to here and this is our shading position

221
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,440
so this is where how we make the cameras

222
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,400
look pretty

223
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
um and again right here i have a control

224
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,160
panel so i can choose what i want i want

225
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,759
to go to camera one right now

226
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,120
i'm gonna do that and

227
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,560
i'm gonna put labels here but we're

228
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,000
still playing with the configuration and

229
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,240
i can see camera one in all of its glory

230
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,919
and then right here is shading so this

231
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,440
is exactly where i'm gonna make

232
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,240
uh make the cameras look how i want them

233
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,800
now

234
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,360
you notice that the number he won here

235
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,199
is red it's actually on air so if we

236
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,880
were streaming we would not

237
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,479
want to edit the camera that's on air we

238
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,759
always try to do the camera that's not

239
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,639
on there

240
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,000
but i can adjust the brightness with

241
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,560
this lever here

242
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,960
um i can use these meters over here to

243
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,319
help me kind of get it where i should

244
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,319
put it up and then i can also change the

245
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,680
db you know if you're familiar with

246
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,560
dslrs or canons or sonys uh this is

247
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
basically your iso so we just call it db

248
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,080
in broadcast world because it's actually

249
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,919
the technical term um

250
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,840
and just like iso it comes up in steps

251
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,199
so bring it back down

252
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,039
and zero is the native iso of the camera

253
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,400
we run out about six here

254
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,479
and change colors basically the

255
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,000
objective of this position is really to

256
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,520
make all the cameras look consistent

257
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,400
with each other

258
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,680
we're not always great at that you can

259
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,199
definitely catch that now this is

260
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,400
something that sometimes the director

261
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,520
will do as well

262
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,720
but we always like to have someone who

263
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,080
is dedicated to this position if

264
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,440
possible

265
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
um and then we also have comms here so

266
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,360
this is just uh the holy land comm

267
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,160
system

268
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,759
uh this is way less expensive than

269
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,440
clearcom and it's wireless it definitely

270
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,360
has its disadvantage over clear com

271
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
but for just doing video it's great we

272
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,120
actually can do up to eight packs

273
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,800
um so eight wireless and then this guy

274
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,240
connects over our cable

275
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
to this one and this position and that

276
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,319
position are both wired in

277
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,680
and they have these pretty great

278
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,360
headsets my favorite feature is you flip

279
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,680
this

280
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,919
forward it's unmuted you flip it back

281
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:30,800
and you're muted

282
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,240
so it's pretty great and you got an ear

283
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,080
open so you can hear the room and that's

284
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,440
all one channel

285
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,640
we're actually adding some equipment

286
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,479
moving some equipment here which is why

287
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,679
it's a mess right here

288
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,479
but um we come over here to our last

289
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,200
position

290
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,839
uh with our social media position so

291
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,800
this is just a mac mini

292
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,320
this one's about seven years old uh and

293
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
we use it to run social media so the

294
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,279
commenting

295
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,880
uh the responding to people answering

296
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,959
questions all happens from this position

297
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:55,920
although we actually haven't been

298
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,839
utilizing it a whole lot for that

299
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,200
it's also great you know there's those

300
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,320
things hey i need to look at the order

301
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,839
service here can i look at the time or

302
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,200
hey i need to print some sheet music

303
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,560
this is a great machine to run to just

304
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,000
to do those things without having to

305
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
bother someone else and kind of you know

306
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,440
take that get in their way so this is a

307
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,560
great computer for that

308
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,080
and i have one of the covers off you can

309
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
see right here but a big design

310
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,680
requirement for me we need to build this

311
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,680
uh booth was to have cable management

312
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,600
that'd be just to be clean but not just

313
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,399
clean

314
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,560
but also useful doesn't matter that it

315
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,160
looks clean and out of the way if

316
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,920
i want to replace the cable or install a

317
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,200
new part and i have to take everything

318
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,000
apart

319
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,200
so that's where this came in we have

320
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,120
these troughs that are

321
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,519
were built and cool story about this we

322
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,320
actually had

323
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,920
someone in our church who does carpentry

324
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,600
professionally who

325
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,120
gave us a really good price we built all

326
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,640
of this and so he built this you know

327
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,959
these are made out of real wood

328
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,160
and the insane thing about that

329
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,320
is if you look online at broadcast

330
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,200
equipment or

331
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,800
that is built for you know big control

332
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,720
rooms they are ridiculously expensive

333
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,839
you're talking about

334
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,680
a piece of furniture this big across ten

335
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,600
thousand dollars because it has rack

336
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,320
mount stuff

337
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,800
and it has cutouts and all the things

338
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,160
but it's made out of particle board

339
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,600
this is real wood you can see the wood

340
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
under here and then we got these

341
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,440
x legs on amazon because it looks pretty

342
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,640
cool and

343
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,959
we built this little five inch box back

344
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,720
here this runs the whole way

345
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,240
and i can show you an area where there's

346
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,320
a little more density of cabling

347
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,760
and it runs to our server room you can

348
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,360
see we bundle things together it's it's

349
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,680
not

350
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,079
beautiful but it's it is serviceable

351
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,279
that's what we care about it has to be

352
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,480
serviceable

353
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,040
um all the sdi comes in here and then

354
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,640
that leads us to

355
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,440
our server room which is right here this

356
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,120
is where the magic happens

357
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,640
you're asking about how we get cables up

358
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,240
here well they all come in through those

359
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,480
pipes we actually installed those pipes

360
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,279
my team did and we bring in all the

361
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,120
green cable you see that's all sdi so

362
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,399
one for each camera

363
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,160
to bring video in and we actually send

364
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,519
one back out

365
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,279
to do camera control so when i'm you

366
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,120
know moving those uh knobs

367
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,800
for on the shading position i'm actually

368
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,320
talking over the to the camera over one

369
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,600
another one of those cables

370
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,880
and the blue is just network there's

371
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,240
security cameras and other network

372
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,200
points in the room

373
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
and we installed this ladder and we

374
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,640
actually did hire contractors not a

375
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,240
company but contractors come in just do

376
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,200
the dressing

377
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,720
and pull some of the cable because they

378
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,399
do a great job at it

379
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,680
and then there's that faster that goes

380
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,519
into the server into the into the trough

381
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,399
right there on the other side of the

382
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:12,720
wall

383
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,079
a little battery for all the battery

384
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,600
backup for all the equipment in the

385
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,320
booth

386
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,920
um and this is everything goes in the

387
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,360
booth that you see right here there's no

388
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,640
other cables that go in there

389
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,360
so uh cable goes over here there's ac in

390
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,920
here

391
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,600
and this is our network rack so this

392
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
actually isn't just for

393
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,640
um like i said you know this server room

394
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,399
was built not just for in this room but

395
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,160
really this half the building this is

396
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,519
all of our network um

397
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,200
servers we have a video storage server

398
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,959
batteries at the bottom but what i'm

399
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,399
sure you're interested in is over here

400
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,920
in video land

401
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,640
so the very top is just a dmx splitter

402
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,800
these are sd card recorders

403
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,720
and then oops i did not need to trip on

404
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,160
that cable

405
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,360
um but pro tip

406
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,600
always make sure that you keep cables

407
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,720
free of your server room

408
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,320
we're actually getting to take these out

409
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,680
these are the old cables and so are

410
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,760
these and replace them with the new sdi

411
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
we just have to terminate that

412
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,320
but we're gonna try that again so uh in

413
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,800
here

414
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,200
we have our switcher which is right here

415
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,079
so this is the device

416
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,480
that actually is cutting the camera so

417
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,519
when we talk

418
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,279
you know use that box over that panel

419
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,720
there to actually take cameras and pull

420
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,680
the lever

421
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,800
we are doing that um here

422
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,320
so um using this box and then this is

423
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,040
our matrix

424
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,720
i told you all the inputs all the

425
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,079
outputs come into here so all of our

426
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,920
cameras come here first

427
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,839
and they get routed to here and that way

428
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,200
that's how i can from that other

429
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,560
position where i'm shading i can take

430
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,920
that camera

431
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,880
and then mix it in video or shade or

432
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,320
whatever and then from there after the

433
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,200
video is mixed

434
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,480
this is also where it's combined with

435
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
audio we'll talk about audio in a minute

436
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,399
it then goes to the encoder now the

437
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,000
stream is as easy as clicking

438
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,040
yeah i got focus lock there

439
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,480
just clicking this on air button and

440
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,639
that sends it right to sub splash

441
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,560
um that's an important piece let me tell

442
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,800
you we were using obs until we got that

443
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,279
guy

444
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,680
and having a stream that getting

445
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,959
streaming is easy

446
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,200
streaming reliably is really hard making

447
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,320
it work every time

448
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
this box has been awesome i would say we

449
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,600
do have really good internet here we

450
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,480
have fiber

451
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,959
if you don't look into resi they have a

452
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,720
really awesome protocol that

453
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,240
works even if your internet is a little

454
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,320
flaky if your internet cuts in and out

455
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,079
if our net cuts out even for a second

456
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,920
our stream's down so this works for us

457
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,120
but it may not work for you and your

458
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,160
environment

459
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,920
uh these are just audio consoles for the

460
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,360
band to mix their ears and then

461
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,519
for audio the real meat and potatoes the

462
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,200
magic sauce that we have

463
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
is waves and that's what does all of our

464
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,120
so basically a daw for our audio

465
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,720
and it does all of our processing for

466
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,560
our broadcast which ties into our audio

467
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,839
console and our audio room and i will

468
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,760
show you that in a moment

469
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,199
um but i'll show you kind of back here

470
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,720
from a cabling perspective because we

471
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,839
put a lot of attention into that

472
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,079
green is all video blues network orange

473
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,600
is special network

474
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,279
um we really try to keep things clean in

475
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,720
here and

476
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,959
um we have these troughs make them take

477
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,399
it up here to our ladder

478
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,920
uh we have video going all throughout

479
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,199
the building like i said some of these

480
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,000
go to the student room

481
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,600
we actually have a spot for a camera to

482
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,839
plug in and then network

483
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,160
we actually had to add these pipes um i

484
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,680
had this agreement with a volunteer

485
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,880
who thought we should put more piping

486
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,920
here and i was like nah i think we're

487
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,800
fine

488
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,199
and you know i thought this box would be

489
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,800
enough for all of our pipes coming in

490
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,600
and um well we saw who won he was right

491
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,480
we needed more pipe

492
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,959
so we had to add those pipes there um

493
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:23,519
and

494
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,040
to fit all of our cabling because you

495
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,399
run a lot of cable when you do projects

496
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,680
like this just especially because this

497
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,399
wasn't just

498
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,680
this room it was the entire building

499
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,320
really but we will leave the server room

500
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,199
we're actually going to be putting a

501
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,320
door here

502
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,839
and i said the thing with projects is

503
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,519
the trim work is so hard like we have a

504
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,519
speaker here to get audio in this room

505
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,199
we do have a plan to put more speakers

506
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,079
here but i'll take you into

507
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,720
why is the focus there we go um to take

508
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,680
you into our audio room

509
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,760
so it's kind of a mess in here right now

510
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,959
because we're also using this for

511
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,000
podcasting

512
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,120
but this is our audio room we have an

513
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,440
m32 that's we also have one at front of

514
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,040
house great console

515
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,800
um a display back here for them to see

516
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,519
what's going on hs8 for our speakers

517
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,600
uh to the left we have a mac mini uh

518
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,760
that does recording it runs um

519
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,600
reaper for recording so doll software

520
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,199
somewhere to logic but it ties in really

521
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,720
well to waves

522
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,760
so we use that this desk was custom

523
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,160
built

524
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,839
by matt baker the same guy who did that

525
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,680
desk and we literally set up our

526
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,440
equipment on the ground i took some tape

527
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,880
and taped around it and that was the

528
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,720
outline for the desk and he built it to

529
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,360
spec

530
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,800
uh that guy's just a headphone amp and

531
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,480
these are really helpful meters

532
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,079
you know in the house it's really easy

533
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,839
to know your levels but for broadcast

534
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,360
what's challenging what happens a lot is

535
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,880
people get excited during worship they

536
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,639
crank up the worship in the mix

537
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,839
and then because they don't want to hear

538
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,759
the teaching as loud they turn it down

539
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,279
well the viewer at home needs to be at

540
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,959
the same level consistently

541
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,120
and so we use these to help with that

542
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,399
and you can change that that's a black

543
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,240
magic device as well

544
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,720
over here though is where the true magic

545
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,079
happens and i could spend

546
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,759
hours talking with this about this um

547
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,399
i actually while i helped design this to

548
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,000
actually set this up and and get the

549
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,519
audio tuned in and really figure out

550
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,800
what plugins we had to use

551
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,680
we had an incredible volunteer who is

552
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,160
actually

553
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,440
now leaving in a couple weeks to go to

554
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,079
school to be an audio engineer

555
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,759
really help us figure out our sound and

556
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,360
dial things and figure out what plug-ins

557
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,480
we needed

558
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,519
you know hooking this up is actually

559
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,000
really easy believe it or not it's the

560
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,240
setting it's figuring out you know how

561
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,759
to tune everything figuring out what

562
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,440
plug-ins you're gonna use that's hard

563
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,639
but we use waves for pretty much

564
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,800
everything we use auto-tune

565
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,240
um you know you can see kind of our

566
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,320
stack on

567
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,639
i think these are our vocal channels

568
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,680
yeah vocal channels

569
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,040
so these are stacked on our vocal

570
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,199
channels um these are actually touch

571
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,240
screens but i don't have them plugged in

572
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,600
for touch right now

573
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,040
why is autofocus not there we go

574
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,880
um and we have so there's your two just

575
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,320
del touch screens that tie back into

576
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,720
there

577
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,199
and they connect to the console over

578
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,759
this waves card right here

579
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,839
um and really we're using the console

580
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,160
for levels or using it for

581
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,320
some basic eq uh sometimes some

582
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,560
compression but really everything else

583
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,839
i think we also have some reverb

584
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,919
channels it's happening on waves

585
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,799
and um for the most part our engineers

586
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,000
can come in and just mix and they don't

587
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,599
have to mess with waves too much

588
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,520
um and so we use that and then also we

589
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,199
use this room for

590
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,679
recording podcasts uh c's are just some

591
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,400
seven b's

592
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,799
we have some cloud uh risers over there

593
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,000
our cloud lifters over there

594
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,760
uh this actually used to be just storage

595
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,280
uh so did the server room and

596
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,959
it worked out really well our builders

597
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,559
never planned on having this facility up

598
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,320
here but it just worked out

599
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,360
i'm gonna music off real quick so

600
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,520
actually work where is that coming from

601
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,640
there we go

602
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,600
so let's pull that down um a good note

603
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,799
with broadcast and that's really

604
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,320
important is to use your dcas

605
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,080
um you know in the house if i mute a

606
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,240
channel you really can't tell

607
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,000
but when you're sitting on headphones or

608
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,320
in your car you really can tell

609
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
and so rather than mute you know the

610
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,679
instrument just it's tempting for you to

611
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,840
hit the mute groups

612
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,720
you don't want to do that you want to

613
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,000
convert these cas and you want to bring

614
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
those down so really program your dc as

615
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,360
well and use those correctly

616
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,400
you can definitely tell when our

617
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,240
engineers who are usually used to mix in

618
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,679
front of house come over here and

619
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,520
use the mute groups that's a big no-no

620
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,679
so

621
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,960
that is pretty much our control room if

622
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,000
you have any more specific

623
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,240
questions definitely feel free to reach

624
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,360
out um

625
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,240
uh shoot me an email a zoom chat maybe

626
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,760
give you a facetime tour

627
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,840
um it's a lot of complexity but like i

628
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,280
kind of said an email

629
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,160
complexity is something that i view is

630
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,840
if it's necessary

631
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,200
i'm all about complexity because it

632
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,880
allows us to do more but with complexity

633
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,520
comes

634
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,120
more training it comes more things that

635
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,880
could fail and for us we had to find

636
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,120
that balance and i think we did

637
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,320
but i always get excited when i can

638
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,520
remove a piece of equipment in fact

639
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,280
we're about to take out our p16s um

640
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,720
because we've been able to move to just

641
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,559
wired and headphones for our

642
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,280
in here so um that's exciting but yeah

643
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,559
that's our broadcast setup if you have

644
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,600
any more questions i'd love to give you

645
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,160
a tour maybe about audio or

646
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,760
if you're in town ever stop by but hope

647
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,559
that helps
